This little API powers a [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/) app for seeing top stories
on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news).

It basically just uses the actual [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) and looks
for top stories and editorializes a little bit (no "Ask HN" or stories older than
2 days, stuff like that).
